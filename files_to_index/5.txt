Doctor Sleep

body:
On highways across America, a tribe of people called the True Knot travel in search of sustenance. They look harmlessâ€”mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs. But as Dan Torrance knows, and spunky twelve-year-old Abra Stone learns, the True Knot are quasi-immortal, living off the steam that children with the shining produce when they are slowly tortured to death.
